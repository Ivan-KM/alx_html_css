HTML & CSS Web Page – From Scratch

This project is a fully functional and responsive web page built entirely from scratch, using only HTML and CSS.
No JavaScript and no external CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc. I used ensuring a pure, semantic, and accessible implementation.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate mastery of:

Semantic HTML structure

Clean and maintainable CSS styling

Accessibility best practices (ARIA, labels, contrast, keyboard navigation)

Responsive design techniques (flexbox, grid, media queries)

Pixel-perfect alignment with the provided designer file

Features

Responsive Layout – Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Accessible Design – Proper use of semantic HTML elements, ARIA attributes, and alt text for images.

Custom Styling – Every element styled with custom CSS (no external frameworks).

Reusable CSS Components – Structured CSS classes for consistency and scalability.
